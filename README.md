# FYP23012 - AI Driven Blockchain Forensics
- a Final Year Project applying machine learning and visualization techniques on the Blockchain Forensics


## Overview
- Large volume of Blockchain-related Frauds appear upon rise in popularity of cryptocurrency.
- This project aims at discover the hidden pattern of anomaly account in Ethereum Blockchain, while provide practical application on detecting potential risks from input blockchain address


### Open sources files for the supervised and unsupervised detection on Ethereum Blockchain
- [x] Labelled Datasets for Ethereum account (anomaly accounts)
- [x] Files containing the pre-processing stages (filtering, feature extraction, and other necessary data handling steps)
- [x] Files for the machine learning (codes and dependencies)
